The intricacy of logic, the use of unusual libraries or frameworks, and the overall design significantly impact processing time and my ability to provide helpful analysis.\n\n* **Code language:** I'm proficient in many programming languages, but my understanding might vary slightly depending on the language's features and my access to relevant documentation and libraries.\n\n* **Task:**  Are you asking me to debug, refactor, generate code, explain code, or something else?  Simpler tasks like finding syntax errors in a small snippet are much easier than complex tasks like designing a large-scale application architecture.\n\n* **My current resource allocation:**  Like any system, I have computational limits.  Extremely large codebases might take longer to process or require me to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks.\n\n\nInstead of focusing on a line count, tell me what you want me to do with the code.  Describe the problem you're facing, and I'll do my best to help, regardless of the number of lines involved.  If the codebase is extremely large, you may want to provide me with specific sections or files relevant to the issue.\n"

This code generates random integers between 1 and 100; adjust the range in `random.randint(1, 100)` as needed.  The `num_iterations` argument controls how many sets of 10 random numbers are generated and averaged.  The code then identifies the largest and smallest of these averages.\n"

Many spreadsheet programs have features or add-ons to help with random data generation.\n3. **Save as CSV:** Once you have 100 entries, save the file as a CSV file (e.g., `people_data.csv`).\n\nIf you need help with generating the full dataset using Python, let me know.
